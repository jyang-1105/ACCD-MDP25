    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      This sketch shows several image orbs bouncing inside the canvas. The movement is non-interactive and non-linear.
      I added a little Perlin noise to the velocity every frame, making the motion feel smoother and more organic.
      When an orb hits a canvas edge, it swaps to the other image. When it hits a rectangular obstacle, it simply bounces off.
    </p>

    <h3>Problems &amp; Solutions</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Sticking issue:</strong> Balls sometimes got stuck on obstacle corners. I solved it by pushing them slightly outward after collision and reducing their speed a bit.</li>
      <li><strong>Too linear motion:</strong> Adding <code>noise()</code> to the velocity made the motion less predictable and more natural.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual balance:</strong> I reduced the number of orbs and resized the canvas to keep the focus on both text and animation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      At first, I only flipped the velocity direction when an orb collided, but that caused them to vibrate or stick at the edges.
      Adding position correction and damping fixed the problem and made the animation feel cleaner and more realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also learned that “non-linear movement” doesn’t just mean randomness—it’s about creating continuous, natural changes.
      The mix of physics and noise produces a balanced, living motion that feels between control and chaos.
