    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      My sketch shows a bunch of colorful orbs bouncing around inside a small field while avoiding several rectangular
      obstacles. The motion is non-interactive (it runs by itself) and non-linear. I add a tiny Perlin noise “push” to
      the velocity each frame, so the paths never feel perfectly mechanical or predictable.
    </p>

    <h3>How it works (short)</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Each orb stores position, velocity, radius, and a base hue.</li>
      <li>On every frame I add a small <code>noise()</code>-based jitter to its velocity, then move it.</li>
      <li>Collisions: elastic reflection on the canvas edges and on the faces of rectangular obstacles.</li>
      <li>To avoid sticking, after a hit I push the orb slightly out along the collision normal and damp the speed a bit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problems &amp; Solutions</h3>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Orbs got stuck on obstacle edges.</strong> I added position correction along the surface normal and a tiny
        random kick after reflection. This removes overlap and stops the jitter.</li>
      <li><strong>Motion looked too “perfect.”</strong> I applied a small <code>noise()</code> term to velocity instead of
        directly to position. That kept momentum but made the movement feel more alive.</li>
      <li><strong>Readability with text on the same page.</strong> I shrank the canvas and placed it under the write-up so the
        documentation stays the focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection (2 paragraphs)</h3>
    <p>
      The most interesting problem for me was the “sticking” bug. At first, I only flipped the velocity when an orb touched
      an obstacle, which looked fine until an orb hit a corner and started vibrating in place. Reading more about collision
      response, I realized I was missing positional correction. After the velocity reflection, I now push the orb slightly
      outward along the collision normal so it no longer overlaps with the rectangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixing that changed the vibe of the whole piece. The animation felt less glitchy and more intentional, and it also
      helped me understand “non-linear” beyond just randomness. The noise is small, but it keeps the system from falling
      into repetitive loops, while the physics rules still give it structure. It ends up somewhere between order and drift,
      which is exactly what I wanted for this assignment.
