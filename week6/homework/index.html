  <h1>Systems, Prototypes, and the New Language of Design</h1>

  <h2>✳️ <em>Programming Design Systems</em> — Rune Madsen</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> “We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture.”<br>
  This quote feels like the core of what it means to design today. Instead of making isolated artifacts, we’re shaping living systems that respond and change. It reminds me that design is no longer just visual — it’s about relationships, interactions, and time.</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> “If graphic designers do not become fluent in this new digital reality, they will become irrelevant.”<br>
  It sounds a bit intimidating, but also motivating. Coding is not just a technical skill — it’s a design language. Understanding code helps me think in systems, not just surfaces, and gives me more creative control over how things behave.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> “Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page.”<br>
  I like this because it challenges the old designer–developer divide. In media design, collaboration and iteration are everything. The idea of a designer who codes or prototypes feels much closer to how creative work actually happens today.</p>

  <h2>🧩 <em>What Do Prototypes Prototype?</em> — Stephanie Houde & Charles Hill</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> “By focusing on the purpose of the prototype—that is, on what it prototypes—we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build.”<br>
  This reframes prototyping as a thinking tool, not a step toward the “final” product. It makes me question what I’m really testing each time I build something — the concept, the interaction, or the implementation?</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> “Prototypes themselves do not necessarily communicate their purpose.”<br>
  I’ve definitely experienced this during critiques when people misread what my prototype was trying to do. This quote reminds me to clearly frame the intent — what I’m exploring, what I’m not — so others can give more relevant feedback.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> “Efficient prototypes produce answers to their designers’ most important questions in the least amount of time.”<br>
  I love how practical this is. Good prototypes aren’t about fidelity or polish; they’re about clarity. It makes me want to work faster, test more often, and treat prototypes as conversations with the project, not mini-final products.</p>

  <h3>💬 Reflection</h3>
  <p>
  Both readings made me think about how design has become less about finished objects and more about processes, systems, and iteration. Whether through code or prototypes, we’re constantly testing relationships — between humans, tools, and ideas. It reminds me that being a media designer means staying flexible: learning, building, breaking, and rebuilding — always curious about what design can become next.
